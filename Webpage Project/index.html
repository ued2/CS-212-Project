    <h1>My Website</h1>
    <p>
      My websites is a really simple website filled with 2 hobbies that i have and infomation about my personal life.
      I've always been into sneakers so reselling shoes was a natural hobby that came with it.
      Cryptocurrency also came in hand in hand with reselling shoes because sometime my buyers would want to
      pay in that currencncy so i had to become familiar with it. I hope to learn as much as i 
      can in web programming so that i can make a website for my dad since hes a author. He also ask me to help
      fix the current website that he has made but i was unable due to the lack of knowledge but after 
      this course i should be able to help him.
