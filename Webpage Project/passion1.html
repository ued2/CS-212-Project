    <h1>Cryptocurrency</h1>
    <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, 
    control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies are a kind of alternative currency and digital 
    currency. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems. The decentralized 
    control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database. 
    Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is generally considered the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Since the release of Bitcoin, 
    over 4,000 altcoins (alternative variants of Bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies) have been created.</p>
    <p>
    These characteristics make Bitcoin fundamentally different from a fiat currency, which is backed by the full faith and credit of its government. 
    Fiat currency issuance is a highly centralized activity supervised by a nationâ€™s central bank. While the bank regulates the amount of currency 
    issued in accordance with its monetary policy objectives, there is theoretically no upper limit to the amount of such currency issuance. 
    In addition, local currency deposits are generally insured against bank failures by a government body. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no such 
    support mechanisms. The value of a Bitcoin is wholly dependent on what investors are willing to pay for it at a point in time.

      With added regulation, institutional investors will be able to breathe easier and have less anxiety about the uncertainty of the cryptocurrency 
      market. In fact, more investors are seeing cryptocurrencies as a viable asset because of their attractive returns: In December 2017 bitcoin hit a 
      record high of almost $20,000 for one tcoin. Although the price has gone down since then, experts predict that Bitcoin's value could actually
      go higher than that 2017 figure.Billionaire investor Tim Draper boldly predicted, for example, that Bitcoin would achieve a value of $250,000 
      per coin by 2022.However, any rise in that direction will be a gradual one. While some institutional investors are investing in cryptocurrencies, 
      others are diligently watching the market. Therefore, the introduction and implementation of regulations may attract some of those watchers to 
      jump in.
