        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
         As a youth, i was always involved in sports.The first sport i ever participated in was track and field. 
         In the 5th grade i started playing pop warner football. Sports is where i made most of the friends i have now. 
         I played football all the way until sophmore year of high school due to knee injury that would allow me to play 
         contact sports anymore. I then choose to focus on track and field through out the rest of high school.

        <h2>Recent</h2>
        <p>
        I decided to attended Northern Arizona University because there engineering program was great.
		    My freshman year I was on path to get a degree in Computer Engineering but later decided to change 
		    to Applied Computer Science after my first year. I'm not completely sure what I want to do after I obtain my degree 
		    but I'm thinking of focusing on entering the Cyber Security field with the knowledge I've obtained while taking the CS courses.

        <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <p>
        About last year i randomly found out about cryptocurrencey and was hooked on trading for about 6 months.
        That was one of my hobbies for a period of time, i also enjoy just relaxing, playing NBA 2k and listening 
        to music. Some of the artist that i listen to on a regular basis are Young Thug, Future, Gunna and Lil Baby.
        I'm a huge Lebron and Cowboys fan. Also i enjoying buying and selling shoes, some would call me a hypebeast 
        and reseller.
